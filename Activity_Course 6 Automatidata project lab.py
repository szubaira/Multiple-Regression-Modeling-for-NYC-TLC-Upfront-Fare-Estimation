# # **Automatidata project**
# **Course 6 - The Nuts and bolts of machine learning**

# You are a data professional in a data analytics firm called Automatidata. Their client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), was impressed with the work you have done and has requested that you build a machine learning model to predict if a customer will not leave a tip. They want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers to customers who are unlikely to tip, since drivers depend on tips.
# 
# A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the following questions.

# # Course 6 End-of-course project: Build a machine learning model
# 
# In this activity, you will practice using tree-based modeling techniques to predict on a binary target class.  
# <br/>   
# 
# **The purpose** of this model is to find ways to generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers.  
#   
# **The goal** of this model is to predict whether or not a customer is a generous tipper.  
# <br/>  
# 
# *This activity has three parts:*
# 
# **Part 1:** Ethical considerations 
# * Consider the ethical implications of the request 
# 
# * Should the objective of the model be adjusted?
# 
# **Part 2:** Feature engineering
# 
# * Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling
# 
# **Part 3:** Modeling
# 
# * Build the models, evaluate them, and advise on next steps
# 
# Follow the instructions and answer the questions below to complete the activity. Then, complete an Executive Summary using the questions listed on the PACE Strategy Document. 
# 
# Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

# 
# # **PACE stages**
# 

# Throughout these project notebooks, you'll see references to the problem-solving framework PACE. The following notebook components are labeled with the respective PACE stage: Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute.

# <img src="images/Plan.png" width="100" height="100" align=left>
# 
# 
# ## PACE: Plan 
# 
# Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document to reflect on the Plan stage.
# 
# In this stage, consider the following questions:
# 
# 1.   What are you being asked to do?
# 
# 
# 2.   What are the ethical implications of the model? What are the consequences of your model making errors?
#   *   What is the likely effect of the model when it predicts a false negative (i.e., when the model says a customer will give a tip, but they actually won't)?
#   
#   *   What is the likely effect of the model when it predicts a false positive (i.e., when the model says a customer will not give a tip, but they actually will)?  
#   
#   
# 3.   Do the benefits of such a model outweigh the potential problems?
#   
# 4.   Would you proceed with the request to build this model? Why or why not?
#  
# 5.   Can the objective be modified to make it less problematic?
#  
# 

# 1. Predict if a customer will not leave a tip.
# 2. Drivers who didn't recieve tips will probably be upset that the app told them a customer would leave a tip. If it happened often, drivers might not trust the app. Drivers are unlikely to pick up people who are predicted to not leave tips. Customers will have difficulty finding a taxi that will pick them up, and might get angry at the taxi company. Even when the model is correct, people who can't afford to tip will find it more difficult to get taxis, which limits the accessibility of taxi service to those pay extra. 
# 3. It's not good to disincentivize drivers from picking up customers. It could also cause a customer backlash. The problems seem to outweigh the benefits. 
# 4. No because effectively limiting equal access to taxis is ethically problematic, and carries a lot of risk.
# 5. We can build a model that predicts the most generous customers. This could accomplish the goal of helping taxi drivers increase their earnings from tips while preventing the wrongful exclusion of certain people from using taxis. 

# Suppose you were to modify the modeling objective so, instead of predicting people who won't tip at all, you predicted people who are particularly generous&mdash;those who will tip 20% or more? Consider the following questions:
# 
# 1.  What features do you need to make this prediction?
# 
# 2.  What would be the target variable?  
# 
# 3.  What metric should you use to evaluate your model? Do you have enough information to decide this now?
# 

# 1. Ideally, we would have behavioral history for each customer, so we could know how much they tipped on previous taxi rides. We'd also want times, dates, and locations of both pickups and dropoffs, estimated fares, and payment method. 
# 2. The target variable would be a binary variable (1 or 0) that indicates whether or not the customer is expected to tip => 20%.
# 3. This is a supervised learning, classification task. We could use accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, area under the ROC curve, or a number of other metrics. However, we don't have enough information at this time to know which are most appropriate. We need to know the class balance of the target variable.

# <img src="images/Analyze.png" width="100" height="100" align=left>
# 
# ## PACE: **Analyze**
# 
# Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Documentto reflect on the Analyze stage.

# ### **Task 2. Feature engineering**
# 
# You have already prepared much of this data and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) in previous courses. 
# 
# Call `info()` on the new combined dataframe.

# In[7]:


#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df0.info()


# You know from your EDA that customers who pay cash generally have a tip amount of $0. To meet the modeling objective, you'll need to sample the data to select only the customers who pay with credit card. 
# 
# Copy `df0` and assign the result to a variable called `df1`. Then, use a Boolean mask to filter `df1` so it contains only customers who paid with credit card.

# In[8]:


# Subset the data to isolate only customers who paid by credit card
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df1 = df0[df0['payment_type']==1]


# ##### **Target**
# 
# Notice that there isn't a column that indicates tip percent, which is what you need to create the target variable. You'll have to engineer it. 
# 
# Add a `tip_percent` column to the dataframe by performing the following calculation:  
# <br/>  
# 
# 
# $$tip\ percent = \frac{tip\ amount}{total\ amount - tip\ amount}$$  
# 
# Round the result to three places beyond the decimal. **This is an important step.** It affects how many customers are labeled as generous tippers. In fact, without performing this step, approximately 1,800 people who do tip ≥ 20% would be labeled as not generous. 
# 
# To understand why, you must consider how floats work. Computers make their calculations using floating-point arithmetic (hence the word "float"). Floating-point arithmetic is a system that allows computers to express both very large numbers and very small numbers with a high degree of precision, encoded in binary. However, precision is limited by the number of bits used to represent a number, which is generally 32 or 64, depending on the capabilities of your operating system. 
# 
# This comes with limitations in that sometimes calculations that should result in clean, precise values end up being encoded as very long decimals. Take, for example, the following calculation:
# 

# In[9]:


# Run this cell
1.1 + 2.2


# Notice the three that is 16 places to the right of the decimal. As a consequence, if you were to then have a step in your code that identifies values ≤ 3.3, this would not be included in the result. Therefore, whenever you perform a calculation to compute a number that is then used to make an important decision or filtration, round the number. How many degrees of precision you round to is your decision, which should be based on your use case. 
# 
# Refer to this [guide for more information related to floating-point arithmetic](https://floating-point-gui.de/formats/fp/).  

# In[10]:


# Create tip % col
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df1['tip_percent'] = round(df1['tip_amount'] / (df1['total_amount'] - df1['tip_amount']), 3)


# Now create another column called `generous`. This will be the target variable. The column should be a binary indicator of whether or not a customer tipped ≥ 20% (0=no, 1=yes).
# 
# 1. Begin by making the `generous` column a copy of the `tip_percent` column.
# 2. Reassign the column by converting it to Boolean (True/False).
# 3. Reassign the column by converting Boolean to binary (1/0).

# In[11]:


# Create 'generous' col (target)
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df1['generous'] = df1['tip_percent']
df1['generous'] = (df1['generous'] >= 0.2)
df1['generous'] = df1['generous'].astype(int)


# <details>
#   <summary><h5>HINT</h5></summary>
# 
# To convert from Boolean to binary, use `.astype(int)` on the column.
# </details>

# #### Create day column

# Next, you're going to be working with the pickup and dropoff columns.
# 
# Convert the `tpep_pickup_datetime` and `tpep_dropoff_datetime` columns to datetime.

# In[12]:


# Convert pickup and dropoff cols to datetime
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df1['tpep_pickup_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df1['tpep_pickup_datetime'], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
df1['tpep_dropoff_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df1['tpep_dropoff_datetime'], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')


# Create a `day` column that contains only the day of the week when each passenger was picked up. Then, convert the values to lowercase.

# In[13]:


# Create a 'day' col
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df1['day'] = df1['tpep_pickup_datetime'].dt.day_name().str.lower()


# 
# <details>
#   <summary><h5>HINT</h5></summary>
# 
# To convert to day name, use `dt.day_name()` on the column.
# </details>

# #### Create time of day columns

# Next, engineer four new columns that represent time of day bins. Each column should contain binary values (0=no, 1=yes) that indicate whether a trip began (picked up) during the following times:
# 
# `am_rush` = [06:00&ndash;10:00)  
# `daytime` = [10:00&ndash;16:00)  
# `pm_rush` = [16:00&ndash;20:00)  
# `nighttime` = [20:00&ndash;06:00)  
# 
# To do this, first create the four columns. For now, each new column should be identical and contain the same information: the hour (only) from the `tpep_pickup_datetime` column.

# In[14]:


# Create 'am_rush' col
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df1['am_rush'] = df1['tpep_pickup_datetime'].dt.hour
# Create 'daytime' col
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df1['daytime'] = df1['tpep_pickup_datetime'].dt.hour
# Create 'pm_rush' col
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df1['pm_rush'] = df1['tpep_pickup_datetime'].dt.hour
# Create 'nighttime' col
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df1['nightime'] = df1['tpep_pickup_datetime'].dt.hour


# You'll need to write four functions to convert each new column to binary (0/1). Begin with `am_rush`. Complete the function so if the hour is between [06:00–10:00), it returns 1, otherwise, it returns 0.

# In[15]:


# Define 'am_rush()' conversion function [06:00–10:00)
    #==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
def am_rush(hour):
    if 6 <= hour['am_rush'] < 10:
        val = 1
    else:
        val = 0
    return val


# Now, apply the `am_rush()` function to the `am_rush` series to perform the conversion. Print the first five values of the column to make sure it did what you expected it to do.
# 
# **Note:** Be careful! If you run this cell twice, the function will be reapplied and the values will all be changed to 0.

# In[16]:


# Apply 'am_rush' function to the 'am_rush' series
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df1['am_rush'] = df1.apply(am_rush, axis=1)
df1['am_rush'].head()


# Write functions to convert the three remaining columns and apply them to their respective series.

# In[17]:


# Define 'daytime()' conversion function [10:00–16:00)
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
def daytime(hour):
    if 10 <= hour['daytime'] < 16:
        val = 1
    else:
        val = 0
    return val


# In[18]:


# Apply 'daytime()' function to the 'daytime' series
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df1['daytime'] = df1.apply(daytime, axis=1)


# In[19]:


# Define 'pm_rush()' conversion function [16:00–20:00)
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
def pm_rush(hour):
    if 16 <= hour['pm_rush'] < 20:
        val = 1
    else:
        val = 0
    return val


# In[20]:


# Apply 'pm_rush()' function to the 'pm_rush' series
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df1['pm_rush'] = df1.apply(pm_rush, axis=1)


# In[21]:


# Define 'nighttime()' conversion function [20:00–06:00)
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
def nightime(hour):
    if 20 <= hour['nightime'] < 24:
        val = 1
    elif 0 <= hour['nightime'] < 6:
        val = 1
    else:
        val = 0
    return val 


# In[22]:


# Apply 'nighttime' function to the 'nighttime' series
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df1['nightime'] = df1.apply(nightime, axis=1)


# #### Create `month` column

# Now, create a `month` column that contains only the abbreviated name of the month when each passenger was picked up, then convert the result to lowercase.

# <details>
#   <summary><h5>HINT</h5></summary>
# 
# Refer to the [strftime cheatsheet](https://strftime.org/) for help.
# </details>

# In[23]:


# Create 'month' col
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df1['month'] = df1['tpep_pickup_datetime'].dt.strftime('%b').str.lower()


# Examine the first five rows of your dataframe.

# In[24]:


#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df1.head()


# #### Drop columns
# 
# Drop redundant and irrelevant columns as well as those that would not be available when the model is deployed. This includes information like payment type, trip distance, tip amount, tip percentage, total amount, toll amount, etc. The target variable (`generous`) must remain in the data because it will get isolated as the `y` data for modeling.

# In[25]:


# Drop columns
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
drop_cols = ['Unnamed: 0', 'tpep_pickup_datetime', 'tpep_dropoff_datetime',
             'payment_type', 'trip_distance', 'store_and_fwd_flag', 'payment_type',
             'fare_amount', 'extra', 'mta_tax', 'tip_amount', 'tolls_amount',
             'improvement_surcharge', 'total_amount', 'tip_percent']
df1 = df1.drop(drop_cols, axis=1)
df1.info()


# #### Variable encoding

# Many of the columns are categorical and will need to be dummied (converted to binary). Some of these columns are numeric, but they actually encode categorical information, such as `RatecodeID` and the pickup and dropoff locations. To make these columns recognizable to the `get_dummies()` function as categorical variables, you'll first need to convert them to `type(str)`. 
# 
# 1. Define a variable called `cols_to_str`, which is a list of the numeric columns that contain categorical information and must be converted to string: `RatecodeID`, `PULocationID`, `DOLocationID`.
# 2. Write a for loop that converts each column in `cols_to_str` to string.
# 

# In[26]:


# 1. Define list of cols to convert to string
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
cols_to_str = ['RatecodeID', 'PULocationID', 'DOLocationID', 'VendorID']
# 2. Convert each column to string
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
for col in cols_to_str:
    df1[col] = df1[col].astype('str')


# 
# <details>
#   <summary><h5>HINT</h5></summary>
# 
# To convert to string, use `astype(str)` on the column.
# </details>

# Now convert all the categorical columns to binary.
# 
# 1. Call `get_dummies()` on the dataframe and assign the results back to a new dataframe called `df2`.
# 

# In[27]:


# Convert categoricals to binary
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df2 = pd.get_dummies(df1, drop_first=True)
df2.info()


# ##### Evaluation metric
# 
# Before modeling, you must decide on an evaluation metric. 
# 
# 1. Examine the class balance of your target variable. 

# In[28]:


# Get class balance of 'generous' col
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df2['generous'].value_counts(normalize=True)


# A little over half of the customers in this dataset were "generous" (tipped ≥ 20%). The dataset is very nearly balanced.
# 
# To determine a metric, consider the cost of both kinds of model error:
# * False positives (the model predicts a tip ≥ 20%, but the customer does not give one)
# * False negatives (the model predicts a tip < 20%, but the customer gives more)
# 
# False positives are worse for cab drivers, because they would pick up a customer expecting a good tip and then not receive one, frustrating the driver.
# 
# False negatives are worse for customers, because a cab driver would likely pick up a different customer who was predicted to tip more&mdash;even when the original customer would have tipped generously.
# 
# **The stakes are relatively even. You want to help taxi drivers make more money, but you don't want this to anger customers. Your metric should weigh both precision and recall equally. Which metric is this?**

# F1 score is the metric that places equal weight on true positives and false positives, and so therefore on precision and recall.

# ## PACE: **Construct**
# 
# Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document to reflect on the Construct stage.

# ### **Task 3. Modeling**

# ##### **Split the data**
# 
# Now you're ready to model. The only remaining step is to split the data into features/target variable and training/testing data. 
# 
# 1. Define a variable `y` that isolates the target variable (`generous`).
# 2. Define a variable `X` that isolates the features.
# 3. Split the data into training and testing sets. Put 20% of the samples into the test set, stratify the data, and set the random state.

# In[29]:


# Isolate target variable (y)
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
y = df2['generous']
# Isolate the features (X)
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
X = df2.drop('generous', axis=1)
# Split into train and test sets
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


# ##### **Random forest**
# 
# Begin with using `GridSearchCV` to tune a random forest model.
# 
# 1. Instantiate the random forest classifier `rf` and set the random state.
# 
# 2. Create a dictionary `cv_params` of any of the following hyperparameters and their corresponding values to tune. The more you tune, the better your model will fit the data, but the longer it will take. 
#  - `max_depth`  
#  - `max_features`  
#  - `max_samples` 
#  - `min_samples_leaf`  
#  - `min_samples_split`
#  - `n_estimators`  
# 
# 3. Define a set `scoring` of scoring metrics for GridSearch to capture (precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy).
# 
# 4. Instantiate the `GridSearchCV` object `rf1`. Pass to it as arguments:
#  - estimator=`rf`
#  - param_grid=`cv_params`
#  - scoring=`scoring`
#  - cv: define the number of you cross-validation folds you want (`cv=_`)
#  - refit: indicate which evaluation metric you want to use to select the model (`refit=_`)
# 
# 
# **Note:** `refit` should be set to `'f1'`.<font/>
# </details>
#  
# 

# In[30]:


# 1. Instantiate the random forest classifier
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
# 2. Create a dictionary of hyperparameters to tune 
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
cv_params = {'max_depth': [None],
             'max_features': [1.0],
             'max_samples': [0.7],
             'min_samples_leaf': [1],
             'min_samples_split': [2],

scoring = ['accuracy', 'precision', 'recall', 'f1']
# 4. Instantiate the GridSearchCV object
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
rf1 = GridSearchCV(rf, cv_params, scoring=scoring, cv=4, refit='f1')


# Now fit the model to the training data. Note that, depending on how many options you include in your search grid and the number of cross-validation folds you select, this could take a very long time&mdash;even hours. If you use 4-fold validation and include only one possible value for each hyperparameter and grow 300 trees to full depth, it should take about 5 minutes. If you add another value for GridSearch to check for, say, `min_samples_split` (so all hyperparameters now have 1 value except for `min_samples_split`, which has 2 possibilities), it would double the time to ~10 minutes. Each additional parameter would approximately double the time.

# If you get a warning that a metric is 0 due to no predicted samples, think about how many features you're sampling with `max_features`. How many features are in the dataset?

# For this project, you will use several models to predict on the test data. Remember that this decision comes with a trade-off. What is the benefit of this? What is the drawback?

# The benefit of using multiple models to predict on the test data is that you can compare models using data that was not to train/tune hyperparameters. This reduces the risk of selecting a model based on how well it fit the training data. 
# 
# The drawback of using the final test data to select a model is that, by using the unseen data to make a decision about which model to use, you no longer have a truly unbiased idea of how your model would be expected to perform on new data. In this case, think of final model selection as another way of "tuning" your model.

# **Question:** What type of errors are more common for your model?

# The model is almost as twice as likely to predict a false positive than it is to predict a false negative. Therefore, type 1 errors are more common. This is less desirable, because it's better for a driver to be pleasantly surprised by a generous tip when they weren't expecting one than to be dissapointed by a low tip when they were expecting a generous one. However, the overall performance of this model is satisfactory.

# ## PACE: **Execute**
# 
# Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document to reflect on the Execute stage.

# ### **Task 4. Conclusion**
# 
# In this step, use the results of the models above to formulate a conclusion. Consider the following questions:
# 
# 1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**  
# 
# Yes, this is model performs acceptably. Its F1 score was 0.7235 and it had an overall accuracy of 0.6865. It correctly identified 78% of the actual responders in the test set, which is 48% better than a random guess. It may be worthwhile to test the model with a select group of taxi drivers to get feedback. 
# 
# 2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   
# 
# Unfortunately, random forest is not the most transparent machine learning algorithm. We know that VendorID, predicted_fare, mean_duration, and mean_distance are the most important features, but we don't know how they influence tipping. This would require further exploration. It is interesting that they influence tipping. This would require further exploration. It is interesting that VendorID is the most predictive feature. This seems to indicate that one of the two vendors tends to attract more generous customers. It may be worth performing statistical tests on the different vendors to examine this further.
# 
# 3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?**  
# 
# There are almost always additional features that can be engineered, but hopefully the most obvious ones were generated during the first round of modeling. In our case, we could try creating three new columns that indicate if the trip distance is short, medium, or far. We could also engineer a column that gives a ratio that represents (the amount of money from the fare amount to the nearest higher multiple of 5)/ fare amount. For example, if there were 12, the value in this column would be 0.25, because of 12 to the nearest higher multiple of 5 (15) is 3 divided by 12 is 0.25. The intuition for this feature is that people might be likely to simply round up their tip, so journeys with fares with values just under a multiple of 5 may have lower tip percentages than those with fare values just over a multiple of 5. We could also do the same thing for fares to the nearest 10. 
# 
# 4. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?**   
# 
# It would probably be very helpful to have past tipping behavior for each customer. It would also be valuable to have accurate tip values for customers who pay with cash. It would be helpful to have a lot more data. With enough data, we could create a unique feature for each pickup/dropoff combination. 
# 
# Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? Consider any insights that you could report back to stakeholders.
