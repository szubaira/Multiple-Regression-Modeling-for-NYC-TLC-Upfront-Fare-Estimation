# NYC Taxi Fare Estimation Regression Model - Data Consulting Project

**Project Status**: Completed

**Framework**: PACE (Prepare, Analyze, Construct, Execute)

**Client**: New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)

**Consulting Firm**: Automatidata

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a regression model to predict New York City taxi cab fares, helping riders estimate their ride costs in advance. Automatidata is collaborating with the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) to leverage historical ride and fare data to build an accurate, data-driven model. The solution will enable riders to get an upfront fare estimate based on key factors such as distance, time, traffic conditions, and other fare variables.

The project is focused on transforming existing, unused data into a practical solution that enhances the user experience for TLC riders.

## Project Phases

### 1. **Plan**

In this phase, we established the project scope and gathered all necessary requirements from the client. The initial project proposal and data investigation were conducted, outlining the key variables for the regression model and defining the milestones.

### 2. **Analyze**

The analysis phase involves cleaning, exploring, and processing historical fare data using Python. This will help identify key predictors for taxi fare and determine the best features for our regression model. Initial data exploration has been completed, and the next step is feature selection and preparing data for modeling.

### 3. **Construct**

During this phase, we will build and refine the regression model to predict taxi fares. We will apply machine learning techniques, such as linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods, to train the model. This phase will also involve validating the model’s accuracy using test data and adjusting it based on the results.

### 4. **Execute**

The execution phase will involve deploying the model into a user-friendly app, allowing riders to input ride details and receive an estimated fare. The app will undergo user testing to ensure the model’s predictions are reliable and useful. Based on feedback, further iterations will be made to improve the user experience
